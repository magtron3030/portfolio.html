#Portfolio.htlm

##Description 
This is a page that I can use for my future portfolio work as I create more projects. I have links at the top of my page that guide the user to the area on the page where the information is. I put in an about me section at the top that describes a little bit about myself. I have links to webpages that I havent personally done. Our instructor said we can do that to demonstrate how we would link to other sites. I used photos I have taken and linked them the websites that talk about that area. You can click on the link or the photo to be taken to the site. Towards the bottom I have a link for my resume that takes you to my Facebook page. Again this is a place holder for when I actually have a resume built that is geared towards coding. At the very bottom of the page I have my e mail, phone number, instagram, and linked in listed under a contact me area. The e mail and phone number dont go anywhere but the instagram and linkedin do.
